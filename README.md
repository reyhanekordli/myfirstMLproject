# myfirstMLproject

In this project I estimated the price of a laptop with given informations as input:

with "BeautifullSoup" I got HTML codes from https://www.kalaoma.com/ adrress and put it in a database by MySQL,
then with "tree.DecisionTreeRegressor()" fited the info into ML model..

It is my first project and it has so much problem so don't bother by it.

Thanks
